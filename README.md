This plugin displays data from user demographics and LMS interactions, along with managing options for the post-LMS module evaluations integrated with Formidable.  It is custom work for the University of Washington Center for Health Sciences Interprofessional Education, Research and Practice ( CHSIE ).


== Description ==

CHSIE Data Display adds a top-level menu item to the WP admin area.  The page itself is an app that runs pre-written MySQL queries on the WP database and returns sortable tables of demographic and LMS data for consumption and CSV export.  

A secondary tab on the page allows admins to specify customizable text on the post-evaluation popups generated for the LMS assessments.  These custom settings are shared across all such popups.


== Installation ==

1. Download the `/chsie-data-display` folder.
2. Zip that folder, then upload it to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
